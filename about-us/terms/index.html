<h3>8. REGISTRATION AND SECURITY</h3>
<p>As a condition to using Services, you may be required to register with Company and select a password and user name (&#8220;Company User ID&#8221;). You shall provide Company with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your account. You may not (i) select or use as a Company User ID a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (ii) use as a Company User ID a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorisation. Company reserves the right to refuse registration of or cancel a Company User ID in its discretion. You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password.</p>
<h3>9. INDEMNITY</h3>
<p>You will indemnify and hold Company, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, and employees harmless (including, without limitation, from all damages, liabilities, settlements, costs and legal fees) from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of your access to the Services, use of the Services, your violation of this Agreement, or the infringement by you or any third party using your account of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.</p>
<h3>10. THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</h3>
<p>The Services may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Company. When you access third party websites, you do so at your own risk. Company encourages you to be aware when you leave the Website and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website that you visit. Company has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites. In addition, Company will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site. By using the Services, you expressly relieve and hold harmless Company from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website. Your interactions with organisations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organisations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Company shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is a dispute between participants on this Site, or between users and any third party, you understand and agree that Company is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you hereby release Company, its officers, employees, agents, and successors in rights from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our service.</p>
<h3>11. TERMINATION</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your use of the Services or your account at any time by contacting us at info@missionv.ie. Company may suspend or terminate your access to the Services, Site or your account at any time, for any reason (without cause or for your violation of any term of this Agreement), and without warning or notice, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership.

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p>
<h3>12. MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
<p>The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company&#8217;s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including &#8220;line-noise&#8221; interference). If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms of Use are governed by the laws in force in the Republic of Ireland. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<h3>13. GENERAL</h3>
<p>(i) We do not accept any liability for any failure to comply with the Terms of Service where the failure is due to circumstances beyond our reasonablecontrol.</p>
<p>(ii) If we waive any rights available to us under these Terms of Service on one occasion, this does not mean that those rights will automatically be waived on any other occasion.</p>
<p>(iii) If any of the Terms of Service are held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal for any reason, the remaining terms and conditions will nevertheless continue in full force.</p>
