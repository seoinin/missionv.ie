		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback Simon. I really made my point about social annotation poorly by rushing the end of this (long) blog post and apparently tying the notion to the Kindle. But I&#039;m using the Kindle as an &#039;eat your own dogfood&#039; example which a number of us on #edchatie can experiment with. A better example for younger kids would be where Mary Ann Reilly&#039;s son learned all he needed to set up his own Minecraft server from the &#039;socially annotated&#039; help videos on YouTube. There&#039;s a lot of overlap here with the &#039;remix culture&#039; that I&#039;m reading about now on &quot;A New Culture of Learning&quot;.... and really it&#039;s the notion that kids want to be more engaged in a community of learning where they&#039;re sharing comments on their learning (eg. the community forums on the Scratch website).]]></description>
