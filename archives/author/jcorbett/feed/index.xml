				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last evening Margaret gave a talk at the <em>8th Global Virtual Meeting for Gifted Education</em>, organized by Roya Klinger of the <a href="http://www.begabungszentrum-bayern.de/english/">Bavarian Centre for gifted and talented children</a>. There was a great attendance as can be seen in the images below and we&#8217;re delighted at how <a href="http://creatingcurriculum.wordpress.com/2011/05/29/another-great-sl-meeting-in-giftedness/">well received</a> it was &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, our guest speaker was Margaret [Keane] of http://giftedkids.ie/ talking about MissionV, an amazing programme that has piloted well and is set to grow. MissionV brings together the strands of gifted education, e-learning, and game-based learning in very creative ways – so creative that it can be full of surprises. While students were very successfully moving through the expected steps of historical 3D reconstruction on the ground, it took staff a wee while to notice that they were exceeding expectations with a second group of constructions high in the virtual atmosphere!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-895" href="http://missionv.ie/?attachment_id=895"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-895" title="Presenting in Second Life" src="http://missionv.ie/wp-content/uploads/roya921.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/roya921.jpg 700w, /wp-content/uploads/roya921-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interesting thing about delivering a presentation in <em>Second Life</em> for MissionV is that its very much a case of &#8216;eating our own dogfood&#8217;. The Virtual World is our platform of choice but like any other technology its only a tool. Many of the attendees at last night&#8217;s event are Second Life newbies and yet they soon forgot about the novelty and quickly settled into the talk, while absolutely enjoying the unique advantages afforded by the 3D space &#8211; primarily a real sense of presence.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re very much looking forward to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bavarian-Center-for-Gifted-and-Talented-Children/54861321757">next session on June 25th with Prof. Dr. Ernst Hany</a>.</p>

We were there to talk about <em>&#8216;Game-based Learning in Virtual Worlds</em>&#8216; and to meet with pioneering educators.</p>
<p>The day got off to a wonderful start with <a href="http://www.christianpayne.com/">Christian Payne</a> speaking on <em>&#8216;Mobile Story Making&#8217;</em>, ostensibly, but really regaling us with tales of life lived to the full. Entertaining, affecting, inspiring.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/23724480">ICT in Education 2011 : Christian Payne : Mobile Story Making</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user373954">StudioSix @ Tipperary Institute</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>A few soundbites we took particular note of were &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing is not doing. Only doing is doing</li>
<li>Location is the bridge between online &amp; offline</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t write words, write stories</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up was <a href="http://www.fis.ie/ciaranmcc/">Ciaran McCormack</a> on <em>&#8216;Preparing our teachers for the Storytellers of tomorrow&#8217;</em>. He told us when teenagers were asked to comment on schools 50% said it was boring while 42% said it was tiring.  These results show that there is a real lack of engagement on behalf of students and that we as educators have to find new ways to engage, inspire and excite students about their learning. <em>(Or as the Game Based Learning theorist  <a title="James Paul Gee" href="http://www.jamespaulgee.com/" target="_blank">James Paul Gee</a> says give them an emotional connection to learning!)</em> And then he nailed the whole point of storytelling &#8211; <em>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about the production, it&#8217;s about the process&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>One of our favourite workshops of the day was, without a doubt, Stephen&#8217;s Howell&#8217;s <a href="http://scratch.ie/" target="_blank">Scratch </a>tutorial &#8211; the funniest thing was looking around the room and seeing all of these teachers with big childlike grins on their faces making their &#8220;sprite&#8221; do cartwheels.  Scratch is just a fantastic introduction to programming for kids. Then Stephen showed his amazing hack for the kinect &#8211; real time digital puppeteering &#8211; just fantastic.  Here are some useful links that Stephen mentioned as part of his presentation:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="Waterford Institute of Technology" src="http://www.planmystudy.com/gifs/waterford_institute.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="183" />On Thursday 19th May 2011 Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) is hosting the <a href="http://www.wit.ie/Research/ResearchGroupsCentres/Groups/GameBasedLearning/igbl2011/">Irish Symposium on Game-Based Learning</a>.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Game-Based Learning (GBL) is a fascinating medium which has the potential to increase both motivation and learning on the part of the learners. GBL has captured the interest of researchers, and some educators have already started to embrace this technology. Although there is a solid body of evidence on the educational effectiveness of GBL, it still needs to gain more recognition amongst Irish teachers, lecturers, and policy-makers.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Dr. Patrick Felicia, researcher at the Department of Computer Science in WIT appears to be one of the main organizers and it just so happens that I&#8217;ve been recently poring over his wonderful booklet (PDF) <em><a href="http://games.eun.org/upload/gis_handbook_en.pdf">Digital Games in Schools: A Handbook for Teachers</a></em>. The following is just one of many powerful insights I could extract from it &#8211;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Digital games can have an emotional impact onplayers, increasing their self-esteem (provided the proper monitoring is applied) and enabling them to engage in social activities. Playing can have a calming effect on participants who, as in other entertaining activities (e.g. watching films), feel a wide range of emotions, but in a safe andcontrolled environment. Emotions experienced during play can vary through joy, empathy, anger, frustration or triumph. This succession of emotions tends to keep the players immersed. </em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, studies have shown that emotions can help thememorization process, especially if the emotional content or tone of the material to be learnedmatches the emotions of the learner. Because they induce different emotions in the players, digital games might help them to remember facts more vividly and so assist the cognitive process. &#8220;</em></p>
<p>Needless to say we&#8217;ve already registered to attend the Game-Based Learning symposium and are thoroughly looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Joel Levin is a computer teacher at a private school in New York City. His blog &#8211; <a href="http://minecraftteacher.net/">The Minecraft Teacher </a>&#8211; chronicles his foray into using Minecraft in the classroom. And has earned him minor celebrity status in teaching circles.</p>
<p>In one <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/04/educational-building-blocks-how-minecraft-is-being-used-in-the-classroom.ars">interview</a> Joel revealed &#8211; <em>&#8220;l chose Minecraft specifically because it&#8217;s so open-ended. The game presents you with a huge open world and you can do any of a dozen <a id="mypro" href="https://iphone8releasedate.com/">iphone 8 rumors</a> different preset activities. Or you can go off and create your own content. That alone gives me a ton of freedom to invent content for the kids to engage in. I don&#8217;t let them just play the game however they want. They must follow a path I lay out for them, which allows me to carry out lesson plans.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In the video below Joel demonstrates a Tutorial World walkthrough which gives a great idea of the educational scope available in a Minecraft world &#8211;</p>
